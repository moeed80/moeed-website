Throughout my career, I have advocated for media innovation, digital strategy, and the critical role of technology in global journalism. This section includes my thoughts and analyses on news today and the future of media and organizational transformation.

Topics often covered include:

* **Digital Transformation:** Leading large news organizations through strategic, product, and operational changes.
* **Verification and Trust:** Pioneering workflows for citizen journalism and social media verification to counter misinformation.
* **Audience Shifts:** Strategies for securing growth among younger global audiences, especially on platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
* **Media Incubation:** The process of launching successful digital media projects like AJ+.
